Dear User

To run this project, first please run "<b>composer install</b>"

Then please create a MySQL DB with this name "<b>gm_db</b>" then import the file that is called "<b>G_M_DB.sql</b>"

The place to edit DB connection is "<b>lib\model.class</b>" in the "<b>__construct</b>" function 

To run the project you have to use apache server

You can enter the project using this url "http://localhost/Games_Maker_v1.3/webroot/"

It's highly recommended to use these credentials{username: MJ1995, pass: 02159023_M} because you'll find 2 demo examples are already built

Thanks
